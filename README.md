- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @gonzalezjoem
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ...bass, drums, guitar, movies, and 3d printing (Blender v2.8, Ultimaker Cura 4.12.1, on upgraded Anet A8 stepper motors and Duet 2 SiFi board)
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ...
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ...

I am having trouble printing with the new Duet 2 board. All axes work, including extruder. No matter which figures I use, I can't seem to keep the printhead on the heatbed.
The printhead seems to be printing the shape I'm trying to print except it prints off the plate, with the printhead always coming back passed the heatbed left edge and to the
horizontal endstop, then continues to print. I've tried different settings and nothing helps. I think, and I realize I could be wrong, but I think I am not measuring the pringhead
to nozzle, or endstop to heatbed edge, or I don't know what else. No matter what fugures I use for X min, the printhead always goes passed the heatbed and goes to the X endstop. 
I've included below the config.g file from Duet 2 and Cura printhead settings because they are related to this problem. Could someone please help me? Configs below:

part of Config.g file:

; Axis Limits
M208 X10 Y10 Z0.2 S1         ; set axis minimums
M208 X220 Y220 Z240 S0       ; set axis maxima

; Endstops
